<p><font color="white" size="6" face="verdana">The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu Spanish pronunciation: [es'taðjo san'tja?o ße?na'ßeu?] (About this soundlisten)) is a football stadium in Madrid, Spain. With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.[2]

The Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world's most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010[4] and hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Final.[5] The final matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship, a FIFA World Cup final and a Copa Libertadores final.
